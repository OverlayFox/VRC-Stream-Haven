# VRC-Stream-Haven

> A self-hosted CDN for VRChat streaming with intelligent geographic distribution

VRC-Stream-Haven is a distributed content delivery network designed for publishing RTSP signals to the web. <br>
It enables multiple servers to work together as a "Haven," automatically routing viewers to the geographically closest server for optimal stream stability and reduced latency.

⚠️ **Early Development Notice**: This project is currently in pre-alpha stage. Expect bugs and missing features.

## Features

- **Distributed CDN Architecture**: Multiple servers work together to serve streams efficiently
- **Intelligent Geographic Routing**: Automatically routes viewers to the nearest available server
- **SRT to RTSP Conversion**: Receives SRT feeds and remuxes to RTSP for web delivery
- **Lightweight & Efficient**: Minimal resource footprint using native Go libraries without external dependencies
- **Self-Hosted**: Full control over your streaming infrastructure

## Architecture

VRC-Stream-Haven uses a hub-and-spoke model with two types of servers:

### Flagship (Main Server)

- Receives the primary SRT feed from the broadcaster
- Manages the Haven network of Escort servers
- Routes viewers to the optimal Escort based on geographic proximity
- Serves as fallback when no Escorts are available

### Escort (Edge Server)

- Pulls the SRT feed from the Flagship
- Remuxes to RTSP for local viewers
- Registers with the Flagship via API using a shared passphrase
- Reduces load on the Flagship and improves viewer experience

**Flow Diagram:**

```
Broadcaster (SRT) → Flagship → Escort 1 → Viewers (nearby)
                            → Escort 2 → Viewers (nearby)
                            → Escort n → Viewers (nearby)
                            → Viewers (direct fallback)
```

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26 or higher
- Network infrastructure capable of SRT/RTSP streaming
- (Optional but recommended) IP2Location LITE database for geolocation

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VRC-Stream-Haven.git
cd VRC-Stream-Haven

# Build the project
make build

# Or build manually
go build -o vrc-stream-haven
```

## Configuration

### IP2Location Database Setup (Recommended)

VRC-Stream-Haven uses the [IP2Location LITE database](https://lite.ip2location.com) for IP geolocation to calculate distances between servers and viewers.

> **Privacy Note**: Escort locations are stored in RAM and logs, but viewer locations are only calculated temporarily and not persisted.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Create a free account at [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)
2. Navigate to the `Manage license keys` page
3. Click on `Generate new license key` - This is free to do
4. Give it a unique name
5. Once created, copy the `Account ID` and `License key`
6. Add your key to the config file:
   ```
   MaxMindAccountID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE
   MaxMindLicenseKey=YOUR_KEY_HERE
   ```

The application will automatically check for and download database updates on startup.

> **Note**: The database is not included in the repository due to licensing restrictions.

## Usage

### Running as Flagship

```bash
./vrc-stream-haven flagship [options]
```

### Running as Escort

```bash
./vrc-stream-haven escort --flagship-url=<url> --passphrase=<secret> [options]
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Proof of Concept
- [x] Code refactoring for improved readability and maintainability
- [x] Better circular buffering
- [x] MPEG-TS Demuxing
- [x] RTSP Muxing
- [ ] Allow only a certain amount of viewers per node
- [ ] Syncing between SRT-Servers and RTSP clients
- [ ] Pirate Mode - allows server to only broadcast the RTSP signal on LAN
- [ ] SRT chaining - allows nodes to pull SRT streams from other nodes
- [ ] Web interface for monitoring
- [ ] When a escort disconnects the readers shouldn't be dropped but redirected to a different escort
